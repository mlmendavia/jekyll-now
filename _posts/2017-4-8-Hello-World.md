title: My first blog post using GitHub and Jekyll!
---

This is my first blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this first post, I'll share some notes on what I learned today at the first class meeting of the very first [Learn Teach Code](http://learnteachcode.org/) UnBootcamp experiment.

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- how to use GitHub
- everyones name 

## Questions:

- how to write out our variable with JS
- we can host a site on github? 

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- forgot the basic structure of writing a variable
- forgot the thought process that I learned in the intro to JS weekend. 

## Useful links to save for later:

- https://mlmendavia.github.io/
- ...thing 2

## My next goals:

- add to my 50 questions list
- write this variable out
